Looking for 12 testers to help publish my Android game (Closed Testing) – I’ll test yours in return!
Hi! I'm launching my first Android game and need 12 testers to join a closed test for 14 days (Google Play requirement before publishing).

Join my group first(https://groups.google.com/g/letsdoit7)then:

✅ Just install the game via Play Store link(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Baku.BadBoy)

✅ Keep it for 14 days (no heavy testing needed)

✅ I’ll test your app/game in return if needed! comment down

I’ve created a Google Group to give access.

Thanks for helping an indie dev! 🙏🎮
